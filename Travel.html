        <h1>Travelling</h1>
        
        <p>I'm lucky to say that as an 19 year old, I would consider myself fairly well travelled. When I was 7 my parents
            bought us a camper van and since then we have driven it to 13 different countries in Europe.</p>
      
        <p>I've always loved exploring new places and experiencing the different cultures from country to country, so spending 
        four weeks attempting to hit up as many places as possible with my parents and my two sisters is an ideal way to spend 
        my summer.</p>
  
        <p>Of course, like any other family, we like to relax on holidays, so a good chunk of those four weeks tends to be dedicated 
            to balming out on golden sand beaches in Spain or France, but the rest of the time is well spent visiting cities like 
            Amsterdam and Venice and engaging in classic touristy things like touring caves and visiting museums.</p>

        <p>I love travelling and won't be satisfied until i've seen as much of the world as possible in my lifetime.</p>

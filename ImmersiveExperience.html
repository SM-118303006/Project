    <center><h1>Immersive Experience</h1>
        <p>An immersive experience is an illusory environment that completely surrounds you such that 
           you feel that you are inside it and part of it. The term is associated with technology environments 
           that command the senses such as virtual reality and mixed reality.

           The three pillars of immersive experiences are visual quality, sound quality, and intuitive interactions. 
           Full immersion can only be achieved by simultaneously focusing on these pillars.

    <center><p> A blockchain is best defined as a time-stamped series of immutable 
            record of data that is controlled by cluster of computers that are not owned by any single entity. 
            Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) are secured and attached to each other using 
            cryptographic principles (i.e. chain).</p>
